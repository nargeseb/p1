Front-end refers to the part of a website or application that users see and interact with. Simply put, it's what's in front of your eyes and what you engage with, such as web page designs, buttons, forms, and images.
The front-end consists of several key components:

HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of a web page, like the skeleton of a building.
CSS: Handles the appearance and styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layout.
JavaScript: Enables interactive elements and behaviors on web pages, such as animations and dynamic content updates.
